# Let's say your user name is agross and you work in feature/foo. git feierabend
# will create a server-side branch named refs/private/agross/feature/foo. You
# can inspect server-side branches by running git ls-remote origin.
#
# To restore the branch on your or anybody elses machine run:
# git fetch origin refs/private/agross/feature/foo
# Which stores the downloaded commits as FETCH_HEAD. You can then create a new
# branch with the downloaded commits by running
# git branch something FETCH_HEAD
#
# If you are in detached HEAD state the server-side branch will be named
# "detached-HEAD".
