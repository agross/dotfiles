"""Shared cheap English-detection helpers for banned_phrase_scan.py,
structure_scan.py, and silhouette_scan.py. All three scanners must decline the
same non-English inputs, so this table and its two functions live in exactly
one place.

Also home to the shared prose-view helpers (tokenizer, markdown stripper,
paragraph splitter) used by structure_scan.py and silhouette_scan.py. Those
two scanners previously carried private copies of these functions that had
drifted from each other (structure blanked blockquote lines, silhouette
didn't; silhouette stripped **bold**, structure didn't). strip_markdown_for_prose
below is the UNION of both original code paths, gated behind flags so each
caller reconciles the drift deliberately rather than silently: structure_scan
passes blank_blockquotes=True, silhouette_scan passes strip_bold=True."""
