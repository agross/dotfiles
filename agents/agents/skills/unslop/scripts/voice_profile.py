"""Build deterministic stylometric voice profiles.

The built-in background table is a compact Writeprints-style English baseline:
common function words seeded from public-domain frequency lists used by classic
authorship-attribution examples, with broad fallback means/stddevs for words not
observed in a caller-supplied background corpus. It is meant only as a stable
normalizer; pass --background with same-genre documents for calibrated work.
