"""
Deterministic dimension-controlled pair generation for the teach calibration game.

Given a base passage and ONE voice dimension, produce a minimal pair (A, B) where
B differs from A along exactly that dimension. The direction of the transform
(e.g. contract -> expand vs expand -> contract) is auto-detected from whichever
pole the base passage already sits at, so every dimension is reversible: feed it
a passage already on one pole and it moves to the other.

Every transform must preserve the must-preserve constraint tokens extracted by
scripts/extract_constraints.py (numbers, dates, names, quotes, units, etc). If a
dimension has no expressible transform in the given passage (neither pole's
pattern is present, or the only candidate transform would drop a constraint),
the command exits 3 with "dimension not expressible in this passage".

Usage:
    python3 calibrate_pairs.py generate --base FILE --dimension DIM --seed N
    python3 calibrate_pairs.py --list-dimensions

Dimensions: contractions, em_dash, sentence_length, connectives, staccato.
