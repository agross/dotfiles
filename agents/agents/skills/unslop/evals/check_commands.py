"""Parity gate for the subcommand router.

Pins the top-level verb surface and keeps SKILL.md's argument-hint, its routing
table, and the files under references/commands/ in exact agreement. A future edit
cannot silently add or drop a verb, orphan a command file, or leave a routed
command without a file.

Checks:
  (a) argument-hint top-level verbs == EXPECTED_TOPLEVEL, exactly.
  (b) every routing-table link resolves to a references/commands/<cmd>.md file,
      and every such file is linked from the routing table (no orphans).
  (c) every top-level verb is routed; any extra routed command is an allowed
      maintenance command.
  (d) each command file is <= MAX_LINES lines.
  (e) each command file's first line is `# /unslop <cmd>`.
